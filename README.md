# csv-timestamp-and-kinect

Boilerplate ugly almost useless stuff for personal use. This is Processing code to playback .csv curves alongside with Kinect v1 recordings, synced via timestamps...

* Records timestamped Kinect data (uses Kinect4Win Processing library [Kinect v1])
* Implements a player to render timestamped data
  * Plays back skeleton recorded by this application
  * Plays back data curves from .csv files with other timestamped motion capture data I had recorded
